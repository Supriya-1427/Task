Here are clear and concise answers to each of your questions:


---

🔹 What does filter() return?
 returns a new array containing all the elements that pass the test (return true) implemented by the provided function.

const numbers = [5, 10, 15];
const result = numbers.filter(num => num > 8);
console.log(result); // [10, 15]


---

🔹 How does reduce() work in JavaScript?

reduce() executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value (e.g., sum, product, or string).

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);
console.log(sum); // 10

acc = accumulator (carries the result)

val = current value

🔹 Difference between slice() and splice()?

Method	Purpose	Returns	Modifies Original?

slice()	Extracts part of array	New array	❌ No
splice()	Adds/removes elements	Removed elements	✅ Yes


// slice
const a = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const sliced = a.slice(1, 3); // [2, 3]

// splice
const b = [1, 2, 3, 4];
b.splice(1, 2, 9); // removes 2 elements at index 1, adds 9 → b becomes [1, 9, 4]

🔹 What is the spread operator (...) used for?

The spread operator (...) is used to:

Clone arrays or objects

Merge arrays or objects

Expand elements in function calls


// Clone
const arr1 = [1, 2];
const copy = [...arr1];

// Merge
const arr2 = [3, 4];
const merged = [...arr1, ...arr2]; // [1, 2, 3, 4]

🔹 How to define a method inside an object?

A method is a function defined inside an object.

const student = {
  name: "Supriya",
  sayHello: function () {
    console.log("Hello, " + this.name);
  }
};

// Call the method
student.sayHello(); //
